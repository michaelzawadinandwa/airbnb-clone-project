 0. Project Initialization

* Created a GitHub repository to host the project.
* Added a `README.md` file to explain the project goals and setup.
* Learned the importance of proper repository structure and documentation from the start.

1. Team Roles and Responsibilities

* Researched roles like Backend Developer, Database Administrator, DevOps Engineer, and Project Manager.
* Documented what each role contributes to a real software team.
* Even as a student working solo, this gave me an understanding of collaboration.

2. Technology Stack Overview

Django: Backend framework for building APIs.
MySQL/PostgreSQL: Relational databases for structured data.
GraphQL: For flexible and efficient data queries.
Docker: To containerize the project for consistency.
GitHub Actions: For CI/CD automation.

## 3. Database Design

* Identified main entities: Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments**.
* Defined fields for each entity (e.g., `name`, `email`, `price`, `status`).
* Learned how relationships connect entities (e.g., a User can make many Bookings).
